Hi, I’m **Yanxin Chen**, a Research Assistant working at the intersection of **Information Systems**, **Computational Neuroscience**, and **Medical AI**, with a background in applied economics. 
My work spans EEG neural modeling, ICU time-series prediction, and interactive network visualizations for financial and biomedical systems — combining domain knowledge with informatics and data-driven tools.

My research interests include:
- Health informatics
- Neural modeling and brain-inspired computation
- AI for healthcare
- Dynamic networks and visual analytics in complex systems
